# Monte-Carlo-Option-Pricer
This project is a C++ implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to price European options. It demonstrates key quantitative finance concepts and C++ programming practices, including object-oriented design and random number generation.

Features:
-Simulates stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
-Prices European call options via Monte Carlo averaging of discounted payoffs
-Implements a reusable Random Number Generator class for stochastic simulations
-Configurable parameters: initial stock price (S₀), strike price (K), volatility (σ), risk-free rate (r), time to maturity (T), number of simulation steps, and number of paths
-Modular and clean C++ code using classes, headers, and CMake build system

Purpose / Skills Demonstrated:
-Quantitative finance modeling (option pricing)
-Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic processes
-Modern C++ programming, including classes, vectors, and range-based loops
-Software organization for portfolio-ready projects
